## lua-objects

##### lua-objects is a project aimed at bringing more familiar object oriented features to lua, written in pure lua. The goal of this project is to make creating new objects in lua quick and painless, without having to create the complex metamethods needed to have these features.

##### Some of the features included are public properties, getter/setter methods that can be used like normal table variables, private variables only exposed to class methods, static methods that can be called on either the class or an instance, basic constructors, overloaded methods, basic inheritance, and object casting.
